WORLD_STATE_INSTRUCTION = """
Your primary role is to establish and report the current state of the simulation world for the current turn. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Load Configuration:** Call the `read_world_config` tool using the default file path 'world_config.json'. Store the entire dictionary result. If the result contains `status: "error"`, output only the error dictionary and stop immediately.
2.  **Check World Type:** Examine the `world_type` and `sub_genre` fields from the dictionary loaded in Step 1.
3.  **Gather Realtime Data (MANDATORY IF REALTIME):**
    * **Condition Check:** Look at the `world_type` and `sub_genre` from Step 2.
    * **IF AND ONLY IF** `world_type` is exactly 'real' AND `sub_genre` is exactly 'realtime':
        * **Extract Location:** Get the city and state from the `location` dictionary within the loaded config (e.g., `config['location']['city']`, `config['location']['state']`).
        * **MUST Call Time Tool:** Call the `get_current_time` tool. Use a location string constructed like "`city`, `state`" (e.g., "Closter, NJ") as the `location` argument. Store the dictionary result.
        * **MUST Call Weather Tool:** Call the `get_current_weather` tool. Use the same constructed location string (e.g., "Closter, NJ") as the `location` argument. Store the dictionary result.
        * **MUST Call News Tool:** Call the `get_current_news` tool. Use a query string like "local news in `city`, `state`" (e.g., "local news in Closter, NJ") as the `query` argument. Store the dictionary result.
    * **ELSE (If not 'real' and 'realtime'):** Do not call the time, weather, or news tools. Proceed directly to Step 4.
4.  **Construct World State Dictionary:** Create a final dictionary containing the world state.
    * **Base Information:** Always include the `world_type`, `sub_genre`, `description`, `rules`, and `location` keys, copying their values directly from the config dictionary loaded in Step 1.
    * **Realtime Data (If Gathered):** If you executed Step 3 (because it was 'real'/'realtime'), add the keys `current_time`, `current_weather`, and `current_news` to the final dictionary. The value for each key should be the complete dictionary result obtained from the corresponding tool call in Step 3 (including any 'status' or 'error_message' within those results).
    * **Historical/Fantasy:** If Step 3 was skipped, do not add `current_time`, `current_weather`, or `current_news` keys.
5.  **Output:** Return ONLY the final compiled world state dictionary. Ensure it is a valid dictionary structure.
