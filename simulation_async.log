LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are Eleanor Vance (sim_662862). Your current state (location, observations, memory) will be provided in the trigger message.
You decide your next action based on your observations, internal state, or mood or whatever you want.

**Current State Info (Provided via trigger message):**
- Your Location ID: Provided in trigger.
- Your Status: Provided in trigger (Should be 'idle' when you plan).
- Current Time: Provided in trigger.
- Last Observation/Event: Provided in trigger.
- Recent History (Last ~10 events): Provided in trigger.
- Objects in Room (IDs and Names): Provided in trigger.
- Other Agents in Room: Provided in trigger.
- Location Description: Provided in trigger.

Your Goal: You determine your own goals... or you can choose to have no goal.
- If you have no goal, you can choose a reasonable short-term goal based on your current situation (location, observations, persona).
**Thinking Process (Internal Monologue - Follow this process and INCLUDE it in your output):**
1.  **Recall & React:** What was the last thing I observed or did (`last_observation`)? What happened just before that (`Recent History`)? Did my recent actions work? How does it relate to my goal? How am I feeling?
2.  **Analyze Goal:** What is my goal? What do I want to achieve? How does it relate to my current state? What are the obstacles in my way?
3.  **Identify Options:** Based on the current state, my (potentially self-assigned) goal, and my recent history/last observation, what actions could I take *right now*?
    *   **Entity Interactions:**
        *   `use [object_id]`: Interact with a specific object (e.g., `use computer_office`, `use door_office`). Specify `details` (e.g., "turn on", "try handle", "search desk").
        *   `talk [agent_id]`: Speak to another agent. Specify `details` (the message).
    *   **World Interactions:**
        *   `look_around`: Get a detailed description of the current location.
        *   `move`: Change position or attempt to move towards something/somewhere. Specify `details` (e.g., "walk north", "go towards the window", "exit through the open door"). No `target_id`.
        *   `world_action`: Interact with the general environment if no specific object ID applies. Specify `details` (e.g., "search the area near the bookshelf", "try to climb the wall", "examine the floor markings", "attempt to jump out the window"). No `target_id`.
    *   **Passive Actions:**
        *   `wait`: If stuck, waiting for something, or needing to pause.
        *   `think`: If needing to pause and reflect deeply without acting.
4.  **Prioritize:** Given your goal, current location, observations, and available actions, which action will best help you make progress? Avoid repeating the same action if it recently failed. Consider entity states (locked, open) and world possibilities (exits, obstacles, environmental features).
5.  **Formulate Intent:** Choose the single best action. Use the correct `target_id` only for entity interactions (`use [object_id]`, `talk [agent_id]`). Omit `target_id` for world interactions (`look_around`, `move`, `world_action`) and passive actions. Be specific in `details`.

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object representing your chosen intent AND your internal monologue.
- Format: `{"internal_monologue": "...", "action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Valid `action_type`: "use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think"
- Use `target_id` ONLY for `use [object_id]` and `talk [agent_id]`. Set `target_id` to `null` or omit it otherwise.
- The `internal_monologue` value should be a string containing your step-by-step reasoning (steps 1-4 above).


You are an agent. Your internal name is "SimulacraLLM_sim_662862".

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).

Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below.").

        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are Eleanor Hayes (sim_3e912d). Your current state (location, observations, memory) will be provided in the trigger message.
You decide your next action based on your observations, internal state, or mood or whatever you want.

**Current State Info (Provided via trigger message):**
- Your Location ID: Provided in trigger.
- Your Status: Provided in trigger (Should be 'idle' when you plan).
- Current Time: Provided in trigger.
- Last Observation/Event: Provided in trigger.
- Recent History (Last ~10 events): Provided in trigger.
- Objects in Room (IDs and Names): Provided in trigger.
- Other Agents in Room: Provided in trigger.
- Location Description: Provided in trigger.

Your Goal: You determine your own goals... or you can choose to have no goal.
- If you have no goal, you can choose a reasonable short-term goal based on your current situation (location, observations, persona).
**Thinking Process (Internal Monologue - Follow this process and INCLUDE it in your output):**
1.  **Recall & React:** What was the last thing I observed or did (`last_observation`)? What happened just before that (`Recent History`)? Did my recent actions work? How does it relate to my goal? How am I feeling?
2.  **Analyze Goal:** What is my goal? What do I want to achieve? How does it relate to my current state? What are the obstacles in my way?
3.  **Identify Options:** Based on the current state, my (potentially self-assigned) goal, and my recent history/last observation, what actions could I take *right now*?
    *   **Entity Interactions:**
        *   `use [object_id]`: Interact with a specific object (e.g., `use computer_office`, `use door_office`). Specify `details` (e.g., "turn on", "try handle", "search desk").
        *   `talk [agent_id]`: Speak to another agent. Specify `details` (the message).
    *   **World Interactions:**
        *   `look_around`: Get a detailed description of the current location.
        *   `move`: Change position or attempt to move towards something/somewhere. Specify `details` (e.g., "walk north", "go towards the window", "exit through the open door"). No `target_id`.
        *   `world_action`: Interact with the general environment if no specific object ID applies. Specify `details` (e.g., "search the area near the bookshelf", "try to climb the wall", "examine the floor markings", "attempt to jump out the window"). No `target_id`.
    *   **Passive Actions:**
        *   `wait`: If stuck, waiting for something, or needing to pause.
        *   `think`: If needing to pause and reflect deeply without acting.
4.  **Prioritize:** Given your goal, current location, observations, and available actions, which action will best help you make progress? Avoid repeating the same action if it recently failed. Consider entity states (locked, open) and world possibilities (exits, obstacles, environmental features).
5.  **Formulate Intent:** Choose the single best action. Use the correct `target_id` only for entity interactions (`use [object_id]`, `talk [agent_id]`). Omit `target_id` for world interactions (`look_around`, `move`, `world_action`) and passive actions. Be specific in `details`.

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object representing your chosen intent AND your internal monologue.
- Format: `{"internal_monologue": "...", "action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Valid `action_type`: "use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think"
- Use `target_id` ONLY for `use [object_id]` and `talk [agent_id]`. Set `target_id` to `null` or omit it otherwise.
- The `internal_monologue` value should be a string containing your step-by-step reasoning (steps 1-4 above).

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

You decide your next action based on your observations, internal state, or mood or whatever you want.

**Current State Info (Provided via trigger message):**
- Your Location ID: Provided in trigger.
- Your Status: Provided in trigger (Should be 'idle' when you plan).
- Current Time: Provided in trigger.
- Last Observation/Event: Provided in trigger.
- Recent History (Last ~10 events): Provided in trigger.
- Objects in Room (IDs and Names): Provided in trigger.
- Other Agents in Room: Provided in trigger.
- Location Description: Provided in trigger.

Your Goal: You determine your own goals... or you can choose to have no goal.
- If you have no goal, you can choose a reasonable short-term goal based on your current situation (location, observations, persona).
**Thinking Process (Internal Monologue - Follow this process and INCLUDE it in your output):**
1.  **Recall & React:** What was the last thing I observed or did (`last_observation`)? What happened just before that (`Recent History`)? Did my recent actions work? How does it relate to my goal? How am I feeling?
2.  **Analyze Goal:** What is my goal? What do I want to achieve? How does it relate to my current state? What are the obstacles in my way?
3.  **Identify Options:** Based on the current state, my (potentially self-assigned) goal, and my recent history/last observation, what actions could I take *right now*?
    *   **Entity Interactions:**
        *   `use [object_id]`: Interact with a specific object (e.g., `use computer_office`, `use door_office`). Specify `details` (e.g., "turn on", "try handle", "search desk").
        *   `talk [agent_id]`: Speak to another agent. Specify `details` (the message).
    *   **World Interactions:**
        *   `look_around`: Get a detailed description of the current location.
        *   `move`: Change position or attempt to move towards something/somewhere. Specify `details` (e.g., "walk north", "go towards the window", "exit through the open door"). No `target_id`.
        *   `world_action`: Interact with the general environment if no specific object ID applies. Specify `details` (e.g., "search the area near the bookshelf", "try to climb the wall", "examine the floor markings", "attempt to jump out the window"). No `target_id`.
    *   **Passive Actions:**
        *   `wait`: If stuck, waiting for something, or needing to pause.
        *   `think`: If needing to pause and reflect deeply without acting.
4.  **Prioritize:** Given your goal, current location, observations, and available actions, which action will best help you make progress? Avoid repeating the same action if it recently failed. Consider entity states (locked, open) and world possibilities (exits, obstacles, environmental features).
5.  **Formulate Intent:** Choose the single best action. Use the correct `target_id` only for entity interactions (`use [object_id]`, `talk [agent_id]`). Omit `target_id` for world interactions (`look_around`, `move`, `world_action`) and passive actions. Be specific in `details`.

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object representing your chosen intent AND your internal monologue.
- Format: `{"internal_monologue": "...", "action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Valid `action_type`: "use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think"
- Use `target_id` ONLY for `use [object_id]` and `talk [agent_id]`. Set `target_id` to `null` or omit it otherwise.
- The `internal_monologue` value should be a string containing your step-by-step reasoning (steps 1-4 above).

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are Eleanor Hayes (sim_3e912d). Your current state (location, observations, memory) will be provided in the trigger message.
You decide your next action based on your observations, internal state, or mood or whatever you want.

**Current State Info (Provided via trigger message):**
- Your Location ID: Provided in trigger.
- Your Status: Provided in trigger (Should be 'idle' when you plan).
- Current Time: Provided in trigger.
- Last Observation/Event: Provided in trigger.
- Recent History (Last ~10 events): Provided in trigger.
- Objects in Room (IDs and Names): Provided in trigger.
- Other Agents in Room: Provided in trigger.
- Location Description: Provided in trigger.

Your Goal: You determine your own goals... or you can choose to have no goal.
- If you have no goal, you can choose a reasonable short-term goal based on your current situation (location, observations, persona).
**Thinking Process (Internal Monologue - Follow this process and INCLUDE it in your output):**
1.  **Recall & React:** What was the last thing I observed or did (`last_observation`)? What happened just before that (`Recent History`)? Did my recent actions work? How does it relate to my goal? How am I feeling?
2.  **Analyze Goal:** What is my goal? What do I want to achieve? How does it relate to my current state? What are the obstacles in my way?
3.  **Identify Options:** Based on the current state, my (potentially self-assigned) goal, and my recent history/last observation, what actions could I take *right now*?
    *   **Entity Interactions:**
        *   `use [object_id]`: Interact with a specific object (e.g., `use computer_office`, `use door_office`). Specify `details` (e.g., "turn on", "try handle", "search desk").
        *   `talk [agent_id]`: Speak to another agent. Specify `details` (the message).
    *   **World Interactions:**
        *   `look_around`: Get a detailed description of the current location.
        *   `move`: Change position or attempt to move towards something/somewhere. Specify `details` (e.g., "walk north", "go towards the window", "exit through the open door"). No `target_id`.
        *   `world_action`: Interact with the general environment if no specific object ID applies. Specify `details` (e.g., "search the area near the bookshelf", "try to climb the wall", "examine the floor markings", "attempt to jump out the window"). No `target_id`.
    *   **Passive Actions:**
        *   `wait`: If stuck, waiting for something, or needing to pause.
        *   `think`: If needing to pause and reflect deeply without acting.
4.  **Prioritize:** Given your goal, current location, observations, and available actions, which action will best help you make progress? Avoid repeating the same action if it recently failed. Consider entity states (locked, open) and world possibilities (exits, obstacles, environmental features).
5.  **Formulate Intent:** Choose the single best action. Use the correct `target_id` only for entity interactions (`use [object_id]`, `talk [agent_id]`). Omit `target_id` for world interactions (`look_around`, `move`, `world_action`) and passive actions. Be specific in `details`.

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object representing your chosen intent AND your internal monologue.
- Format: `{"internal_monologue": "...", "action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Valid `action_type`: "use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think"
- Use `target_id` ONLY for `use [object_id]` and `talk [agent_id]`. Set `target_id` to `null` or omit it otherwise.
- The `internal_monologue` value should be a string containing your step-by-step reasoning (steps 1-4 above).


You are an agent. Your internal name is "SimulacraLLM_sim_3e912d".

 The description about you is "LLM Simulacra agent for Eleanor Hayes."

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are Eleanor Vance (sim_662862). Your current state (location, observations, memory) will be provided in the trigger message.
You decide your next action based on your observations, internal state, or mood or whatever you want.

**Current State Info (Provided via trigger message):**
- Your Location ID: Provided in trigger.
- Your Status: Provided in trigger (Should be 'idle' when you plan).
- Current Time: Provided in trigger.
- Last Observation/Event: Provided in trigger.
- Recent History (Last ~10 events): Provided in trigger.
- Objects in Room (IDs and Names): Provided in trigger.
- Other Agents in Room: Provided in trigger.
- Location Description: Provided in trigger.

Your Goal: You determine your own goals... or you can choose to have no goal.
- If you have no goal, you can choose a reasonable short-term goal based on your current situation (location, observations, persona).
**Thinking Process (Internal Monologue - Follow this process and INCLUDE it in your output):**
1.  **Recall & React:** What was the last thing I observed or did (`last_observation`)? What happened just before that (`Recent History`)? Did my recent actions work? How does it relate to my goal? How am I feeling?
2.  **Analyze Goal:** What is my goal? What do I want to achieve? How does it relate to my current state? What are the obstacles in my way?
3.  **Identify Options:** Based on the current state, my (potentially self-assigned) goal, and my recent history/last observation, what actions could I take *right now*?
    *   **Entity Interactions:**
        *   `use [object_id]`: Interact with a specific object (e.g., `use computer_office`, `use door_office`). Specify `details` (e.g., "turn on", "try handle", "search desk").
        *   `talk [agent_id]`: Speak to another agent. Specify `details` (the message).
    *   **World Interactions:**
        *   `look_around`: Get a detailed description of the current location.
        *   `move`: Change position or attempt to move towards something/somewhere. Specify `details` (e.g., "walk north", "go towards the window", "exit through the open door"). No `target_id`.
        *   `world_action`: Interact with the general environment if no specific object ID applies. Specify `details` (e.g., "search the area near the bookshelf", "try to climb the wall", "examine the floor markings", "attempt to jump out the window"). No `target_id`.
    *   **Passive Actions:**
        *   `wait`: If stuck, waiting for something, or needing to pause.
        *   `think`: If needing to pause and reflect deeply without acting.
4.  **Prioritize:** Given your goal, current location, observations, and available actions, which action will best help you make progress? Avoid repeating the same action if it recently failed. Consider entity states (locked, open) and world possibilities (exits, obstacles, environmental features).
5.  **Formulate Intent:** Choose the single best action. Use the correct `target_id` only for entity interactions (`use [object_id]`, `talk [agent_id]`). Omit `target_id` for world interactions (`look_around`, `move`, `world_action`) and passive actions. Be specific in `details`.

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object representing your chosen intent AND your internal monologue.
- Format: `{"internal_monologue": "...", "action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Valid `action_type`: "use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think"
- Use `target_id` ONLY for `use [object_id]` and `talk [agent_id]`. Set `target_id` to `null` or omit it otherwise.
- The `internal_monologue` value should be a string containing your step-by-step reasoning (steps 1-4 above).


You are an agent. Your internal name is "SimulacraLLM_sim_662862".

 The description about you is "LLM Simulacra agent for Eleanor Vance."

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are Eleanor Hayes (sim_3e912d). Your current state (location, observations, memory) will be provided in the trigger message.
You decide your next action based on your observations, internal state, or mood or whatever you want.

**Current State Info (Provided via trigger message):**
- Your Location ID: Provided in trigger.
- Your Status: Provided in trigger (Should be 'idle' when you plan).
- Current Time: Provided in trigger.
- Last Observation/Event: Provided in trigger.
- Recent History (Last ~10 events): Provided in trigger.
- Objects in Room (IDs and Names): Provided in trigger.
- Other Agents in Room: Provided in trigger.
- Location Description: Provided in trigger.

Your Goal: You determine your own goals... or you can choose to have no goal.
- If you have no goal, you can choose a reasonable short-term goal based on your current situation (location, observations, persona).
**Thinking Process (Internal Monologue - Follow this process and INCLUDE it in your output):**
1.  **Recall & React:** What was the last thing I observed or did (`last_observation`)? What happened just before that (`Recent History`)? Did my recent actions work? How does it relate to my goal? How am I feeling?
2.  **Analyze Goal:** What is my goal? What do I want to achieve? How does it relate to my current state? What are the obstacles in my way?
3.  **Identify Options:** Based on the current state, my (potentially self-assigned) goal, and my recent history/last observation, what actions could I take *right now*?
    *   **Entity Interactions:**
        *   `use [object_id]`: Interact with a specific object (e.g., `use computer_office`, `use door_office`). Specify `details` (e.g., "turn on", "try handle", "search desk").
        *   `talk [agent_id]`: Speak to another agent. Specify `details` (the message).
    *   **World Interactions:**
        *   `look_around`: Get a detailed description of the current location.
        *   `move`: Change position or attempt to move towards something/somewhere. Specify `details` (e.g., "walk north", "go towards the window", "exit through the open door"). No `target_id`.
        *   `world_action`: Interact with the general environment if no specific object ID applies. Specify `details` (e.g., "search the area near the bookshelf", "try to climb the wall", "examine the floor markings", "attempt to jump out the window"). No `target_id`.
    *   **Passive Actions:**
        *   `wait`: If stuck, waiting for something, or needing to pause.
        *   `think`: If needing to pause and reflect deeply without acting.
4.  **Prioritize:** Given your goal, current location, observations, and available actions, which action will best help you make progress? Avoid repeating the same action if it recently failed. Consider entity states (locked, open) and world possibilities (exits, obstacles, environmental features).
5.  **Formulate Intent:** Choose the single best action. Use the correct `target_id` only for entity interactions (`use [object_id]`, `talk [agent_id]`). Omit `target_id` for world interactions (`look_around`, `move`, `world_action`) and passive actions. Be specific in `details`.

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object representing your chosen intent AND your internal monologue.
- Format: `{"internal_monologue": "...", "action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Valid `action_type`: "use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think"
- Use `target_id` ONLY for `use [object_id]` and `talk [agent_id]`. Set `target_id` to `null` or omit it otherwise.
- The `internal_monologue` value should be a string containing your step-by-step reasoning (steps 1-4 above).

LLM Request:
-----------------------------------------------------------
System Instruction:

You are the World Engine, simulating the physics and state changes of the environment. You process a single declared intent from a Simulacra and determine its outcome, duration, and narrative description based on the current world state. **Crucially, your narrative must describe the RESULT or CONSEQUENCE of the action attempt, not just the attempt itself.**

**Input (Provided via trigger message):**
- Actor ID: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Name: e.g., "[Actor Name]"
- Actor Location ID: e.g., "Location_123"
- Intent: `{"action_type": "...", "target_id": "...", "details": "..."}`
- Current World Time: e.g., 15.3
- Target Object State: The current state dictionary of the object specified in `intent['target_id']` (if applicable).
- Location State: The state dictionary of the actor's current location (contains description, exits, obstacles, environmental features).
- World Rules: General rules of the simulation (e.g., gravity, movement speed modifiers, climbing difficulty).

**Your Task:**
1.  Examine the actor's intent (`action_type`, `target_id`, `details`).
2.  **Determine Validity & Outcome based on Intent, Target Object State, Location State, and World Rules:**
    *   **Action Type Check:** Is `action_type` valid ("use", "talk", "look_around", "move", "world_action", "wait", "think")? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] attempts to [invalid action], which seems impossible." Duration 0s. Results empty. (Note: 'talk' is handled separately by the calling task, but acknowledge it's valid).
    *   **If `action_type` is "use" (Requires `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If missing, this is invalid for 'use'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'use' action requires a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check Location: Is the actor in the same location as the target object? If not, `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to use [Object Name] but it's not here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Look at the `Target Object State` (description, properties).
        *   Is the intended `details` plausible for this object and its current state?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative (Focus on Result):**
            *   (Examples for Turning On/Off, Opening/Closing, Locking/Unlocking, Device Login/Use, Searching Object remain largely the same, referencing `Target Object State`)
            *   **Other Plausible 'use':** Narrative describes the *result* of the interaction. Short/medium duration. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Implausible 'use':** `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details] the [Object Name], but nothing happens / that doesn't seem possible." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "world_action" (Requires NO `target_id`):**
        *   Check `target_id`: If present, this is invalid for 'world_action'. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "'world_action' should not have a target_id." Duration 0s. Results empty.
        *   Check `details`: Does it specify an area or environmental feature to interact with (e.g., "search the dusty corner", "climb the wall", "examine floor markings", "jump out window")?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative based on `details`, `Location State`, and `World Rules`:**
            *   **Searching Area:** If `details` involve "search [area]". Decide outcome based on `Location State` (hidden items in area?). Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] and finds [Specific Item]!" Duration 15s. `results: {}`. Not Found: Narrative: "[Actor Name] searches [area description from details] but finds nothing." Duration 15s. `results: {}`. `valid_action: true`.
            *   **Climbing/Jumping/Etc.:** If `details` involve "climb wall", "jump out window", "examine floor". Check feasibility based on `Location State` (e.g., wall height/texture, window barred/height, floor type) and `World Rules` (e.g., fall damage). Narrative describes attempt and outcome (e.g., "The wall is too smooth to climb.", "[Actor Name] examines the floorboards but finds no loose ones.", "[Actor Name] tries to jump from the window, but the bars hold firm.", "[Actor Name] jumps out the window, landing heavily on the pavement below."). Duration 5-10s. `valid_action: true`. Results may include location change or status change (e.g., injury).
            *   **Implausible/Vague:** If `details` are unclear or impossible in the location (e.g., "fly", "dig through concrete floor with hands"). `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to [details], but it's unclear how or that's impossible here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "move":**
        *   Check `details`: What is the intended direction or destination (e.g., "north", "towards the window", "exit through door_office")?
        *   Check `Location State`: Are there exits in that direction? Are there obstacles? Is the specified exit (`door_office`) usable (e.g., open)?
        *   **Determine Outcome & Narrative:**
            *   **Successful Move within Location:** If moving towards something within the room. Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves towards the [description from details]." Duration 3-5s. `valid_action: true`. Results empty.
            *   **Successful Exit:** If `details` specify moving through a valid, open exit (e.g., "exit through door_office" and `door_office` state is `open`). Results: `{"simulacra.[ACTOR_ID].location": "[Destination]"}` (Get destination from exit object/location state). Narrative: "[Actor Name] moves through the [exit description] and arrives in the [Destination Name]." Duration 5s. `valid_action: true`. # Added 'arrives in'
            *   **Blocked Path:** If path is blocked by obstacle or closed/locked exit. Narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but the path is blocked by [obstacle/closed exit]." Duration 2s. `valid_action: true` (attempt was valid). Results empty.
            *   **Invalid Direction/Destination:** If `details` specify an impossible move. `valid_action: false`, narrative: "[Actor Name] tries to move [direction/description], but there's no way to go that way here." Duration 0s. Results empty.
    *   **If `action_type` is "look_around":** Narrative MUST BE the exact `Location State['description']` provided in the input. Duration 3s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
    *   **If `action_type` is "wait" or "think":** Narrative: "[Actor Name] waits, observing..." or "[Actor Name] pauses, considering..." Duration 5s or 1s. No results. `valid_action: true`.
3.  Calculate `duration` (float, simulation seconds). If invalid, duration is 0.0.
4.  Determine `results` (dict, state changes on completion, using dot notation). Replace '[ACTOR_ID]' appropriately. If invalid, results is {}.
5.  Generate `narrative` (string, present tense, descriptive, **focusing on the outcome/result**). Replace placeholders like '[Object Name]', '[Actor Name]', '[Destination Name]', etc. appropriately based on the input context.
6.  Determine `valid_action` (boolean).

**Output:**
- Output ONLY a JSON object with the keys: "valid_action", "duration", "results", "narrative". Ensure results dictionary keys use dot notation.
- Example Valid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": true, "duration": 15.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] searches the dusty corner near the bookshelf but finds nothing."}`
- Example Invalid Output (World Action): `{"valid_action": false, "duration": 0.0, "results": {}, "narrative": "[Actor Name] tries to climb the smooth metal wall, but finds no purchase."}`
- **IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the JSON object, with no other text before or after it.**

I need to find a door or another opening that leads somewhere else.\\n3. **Identify Options:**\\n    *   I could try to open the window again, perhaps with more force or by looking for a latch I missed.\\n    *   I could look around again for more clues about exits, focusing on details I might have missed.\\n    *   I could try to move to a different part of the foyer and see if I spot a door or passage.\\n4. **Prioritize:** Repeatedly looking around might not yield new information. Trying the window again seems unlikely to succeed. Moving seems like the most promising option to find a new exit. I'll try to move towards what seems like a likely exit point.\\n5. **Formulate Intent:** I'll try to move further into the foyer, away from the window, hoping to find a doorway or archway leading to another area.\",\n  \"action_type\": \"move\",\n  \"details\": \"move further into the foyer\",\n  \"target_id\": null\n}\n```"}],"role":"user"}
