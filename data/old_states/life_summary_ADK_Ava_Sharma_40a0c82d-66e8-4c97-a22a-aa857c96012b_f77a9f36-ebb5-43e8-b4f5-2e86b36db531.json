She made progress on the problem and felt a sense of accomplishment.  Ava met with her manager to discuss the progress of a larger project and received positive feedback.  She grabbed a quick lunch, taking advantage of a break in the afternoon for some light exercise.  After work, Ava did some grocery shopping and prepared dinner.  The evening was quiet and she spent time reading and relaxing before getting ready for bed.",
