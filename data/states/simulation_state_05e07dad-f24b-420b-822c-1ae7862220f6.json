My social needs are only moderate, but being the friendly person I am, I always enjoy seeing people. Maybe a walk around town would be a good idea? I could pop into a shop or two, say hello to some familiar faces. Yeah, that sounds much better than forcing myself to sit here and plan when my mind is wandering.

But Michael... he's usually got something interesting to say or some crazy idea he wants to share. As outgoing as I am, and as much as I value my friendships, I also need to prioritize my work. Still, I don't want to be rude. Maybe I should just answer it quickly, see what he wants, and then politely tell him I'm busy.
