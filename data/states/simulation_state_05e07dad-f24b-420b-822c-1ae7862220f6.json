    "[T381.2] The room is spartan but functional. A simple cot sits against one wall, its thin mattress offering little comfort. A metal desk, scarred with age and use, stands opposite, bearing a single flickering lamp. The air is stale, carrying a faint metallic tang, and the only sound is the hum of unseen machinery.",
    "[T381.4] Examining the scarred metal desk, Eleanor Vance notes the grime etched into its surface and the faint scratches that tell silent stories. A single flickering lamp casts long shadows, but reveals no obvious drawers or compartments. The cool, rough texture of the metal is strangely grounding."
