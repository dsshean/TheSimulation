    "[T2.5] At 07:56 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez surveys the room. A comfortable-looking couch sits opposite a sturdy wooden coffee table. To his left, a bookshelf overflows with reading material and trinkets. He spots the front door, the obvious exit to the street, and an archway leading into what appears to be the kitchen.",
    "[T13.2] At 07:56 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel enters the kitchen. The cloudy morning light filters in, giving the room a soft glow. The kitchen appears functional, though perhaps a bit sterile. He can go back to the main area of the Home.",
    "[T16.2] At 07:57 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez scans the kitchen, the cloudy morning light making the stainless steel surfaces gleam faintly. He spots the standard drip Coffee Maker on the counter, likely his first stop. A sharp Kitchen Knife lies nearby, a stark contrast to the mundane refrigerator humming quietly in the corner. He notices doorways leading back to the main living area and towards the dining room.",
    "[T27.3] At 07:57 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), with the cloudy morning light still muted, Daniel starts the coffee maker. The machine sputters to life, a low hum joining the quiet thrum of the refrigerator. He notices the water pitcher and pre-ground coffee nearby, already anticipating that first cup. The brewing coffee smell will soon fill the sterile kitchen.",
    "[T35.3] At 07:57 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), with a cloudy sky casting a muted light into the kitchen, Daniel starts the coffee maker. The machine groans to life, the brewing sound slightly echoing in the otherwise quiet apartment. He anticipates the smell of brewing coffee, a welcome change from the sterile air in the kitchen this morning, especially with the news of storms brewing outside.",
    "[T43.7] At 07:57 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel opens the refrigerator door, the cool air momentarily washing over him amidst the cloudy morning light. Inside, a carton of milk sits next to a carton of eggs, along with cheese, butter, and sliced turkey. He also sees a loaf of bread, likely what he was looking for, an apple, and a carton of orange juice. The refrigerator hums quietly, a stark contrast to the brewing storm the news mentioned.",
    "[T51.8] At 07:57 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel scans the contents of the refrigerator under the cloudy morning light. He finds a loaf of bread nestled amongst other breakfast staples: milk, eggs, cheese, butter, and sliced turkey. An apple and orange juice carton offer additional options. It seems the storms brewing outside, as the news reported, won't deter him from a decent breakfast.",
    "[T55.5] At 07:57 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel scans the kitchen, his gaze sweeping over the countertop where the coffee maker burbles quietly. He spots the butter he was looking for, sitting inside the refrigerator along with milk, eggs, cheese, sliced turkey, orange juice and an apple. A loaf of bread sits nearby, ready for toasting. A Kitchen Knife lies on the counter, a doorway leading to the dining room catching his eye too.",
    "[T69.1] At 07:58 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel rummages inside the kitchen cabinet, revealing a stack of white ceramic plates, a stack of ceramic bowls, a two-slice toaster, a ceramic butter dish, and a box of cereal under the cloudy morning light. He locates both the toaster and the butter dish he was after, ready to prepare some toast as the news talks about impending storms.",
    "[T77.3] At 07:58 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel peered into the kitchen cabinet, revealing neat stacks of plates and bowls. A set of cups sat beside them. While he didn't find exactly what he was looking for in this specific cabinet, it seemed well-stocked with other kitchen essentials. Outside, the cloudy morning hinted at the storms the news was forecasting.",
    "[T85.6] At 07:58 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel grabbed two slices of bread from the refrigerator. The fridge light illuminated the interior as he reached in, showcasing the other items inside: a carton of milk, a carton of eggs, a block of cheddar cheese, a stick of butter, packaged sliced turkey, a loaf of bread, an apple, a carton of orange juice, and bottles of mustard and ketchup. The cloudy morning light filtered through the kitchen window as he shut the door, ready to assemble his breakfast despite the threat of storms mentioned on the news.",
    "[T93.9] At 07:58 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel pulled out two slices of white bread from the loaf inside the refrigerator. The fridge's contents\u2014milk, eggs, cheese, butter, sliced turkey, juice, condiments, and another apple\u2014remained bathed in the cool artificial light as he shut the door. Despite the cloudy morning and the news of impending storms, a simple breakfast of toast seemed like a good way to start the day.",
    "[T157.0] At 07:59 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel slides the bread slices into the toaster. The familiar click and whir of the appliance fill the otherwise quiet kitchen, a backdrop to the cloudy morning just barely visible through the window. He can hear the distant murmur of the news from the living room, the reports of storms, tragedy, and tax relief fading into a background hum as he waits for the toast to pop.",
    "[T190.3] At 08:00 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), the toaster hums softly as Daniel waits for his bread to brown. The smell of heating coils and the promise of toast fills the kitchen. Outside, the cloudy morning casts a grey light through the window, a visual echo of the \"Storms, Tragedy, and Tax Relief\" droning from the news in the other room.",
    "[T204.2] At 08:00 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez waited patiently for the toast to pop. The cloudy light of the morning filtered into the kitchen, muted and grey. The toaster emitted a low hum, a constant counterpoint to the distant drone of the morning news about storms, tragedy, and tax relief. The faint, warm smell of browning bread mingled with the sterile air of the kitchen as he anticipated the simple pleasure of breakfast.",
    "[T209.5] At 08:00 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez grabbed the butter dish. The cloudy morning light glinted off its ceramic surface as he set it down near the toaster, ready to butter his toast once it popped. The low hum of the appliance continued to fill the kitchen, a familiar sound accompanying the distant news reports of storms, tragedy, and tax relief.",
    "[T217.7] At 08:00 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez opened the refrigerator, the cool air momentarily washing over him in the otherwise still-warming kitchen. He quickly located the butter dish amidst the carton of milk, carton of eggs, block of cheddar cheese, packaged sliced turkey, loaf of white bread, apple, carton of orange juice, bottle of yellow mustard, bottle of ketchup, water bottle, leftover pizza, and chocolate pudding.",
    "[T222.8] At 08:00 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez peers into the dim space inside the kitchen cabinet. The cloudy morning provides minimal light, leaving the contents of the cabinet mostly in shadow. He can hear the faint drone of the news about storms, tragedy, and tax relief seeping in from the kitchen as he searches for what he needs.",
    "[T240.8] At 08:01 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel waits for the toast to cool slightly, the warmth still radiating as he carefully picks up the slices. The cloudy morning casts a diffused light across the kitchen counter, and the lingering aroma of toasted bread mixes with a slight metallic tang from the still-warm toaster. The muted sound of the news continues from another room, detailing the day's grim headlines of storms, tragedy, and tax relief.",
    "[T246.1] At 08:01 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel enters the kitchen, the cloudy morning light filtering softly through the window. The air smells faintly of toast from his recent breakfast preparation. He could go back to the cabinet.",
    "[T254.5] At 08:01 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez used the kitchen knife to butter the toast. The cloudy morning offered soft light, illuminating the steam rising from the warm bread as he spread the butter. The knife scraped gently against the toast's surface, a simple sound in the otherwise quiet kitchen, punctuated only by the distant drone of the news reporting on storms, tragedy, and tax relief.",
    "[T262.7] At 08:01 AM on Thursday, July 10, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez used the kitchen knife to butter the toast with butter from the butter dish. The cloudy morning casts a soft light across the kitchen counter as he spreads the butter, the knife making a soft scraping sound against the warm toast. A news report droning in the background talks of storms, tragedy, and tax relief, a somber counterpoint to the simple act of preparing breakfast."

I've got a few minutes while the toast finishes. I could grab the butter dish now so I'm ready. I know I saw the plates in the cabinet so I should grab a plate as well so I don't have to wait to grab it after. I'll use the butter dish now and then grab a plate.",

I'll grab the butter dish from the fridge since I haven't done that yet, and then I'll grab a plate from the cabinet, if there are any in there.

I grabbed the butter dish, that's one thing off the list. Now, before the toast pops up, I wanted to grab a plate so I don't have to fumble around for one later. I know I saw the plates in the cabinet when I grabbed the toaster and butter. I'll move to the cabinet and grab a plate. I need to remember what the id is for the cabinet first.
