    "[T2.6] At 03:04 PM on Monday, June 16, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez scanned the room, taking in his surroundings to locate the exits. A comfortable couch sat against one wall, facing a dark wooden coffee table. A standing lamp cast a warm glow across the space. He noted the doorway leading to the kitchen and the hallway that presumably connected to the bedrooms. He felt he had a good grasp of the apartment's layout, ready for his next move.",

He spotted the doorway to the kitchen, the hallway leading to the bedrooms, and the front door that led out to the building's hallway, all potential exits from the apartment. With the courthouse attack fresh in his mind from the news, Daniel began to feel a little anxious to find his way out.",

        "[T133.5] Okay, still in the elevator. I've been waiting for a while now. I pressed the button for the lobby, so where is it? It's been a journey just trying to get out of the apartment building, and honestly, I'm getting a little antsy to actually *go* somewhere, instead of just running around in circles. I am still set on going to that sushi place in Williamsburg, so let's get this over with. The news has been pretty heavy lately with the courthouse attack and protests, and I'm looking forward to a change of scenery. I am a bit concerned that there are no exits listed for the location that I am going to. Once the elevator stops, I will need to look around to figure out where I can go. I'm still hoping to go to Williamsburg. It's almost like the simulation is messing with me. I should probably just wait and see where the elevator takes me before I start planning too much. The doors should be opening any minute now, but nothing is happening. I guess I'll just keep waiting a little longer. Maybe the elevator is broken. It's really quiet, maybe it's stuck. I should probably just wait a little longer to see if anything happens. If the doors don't open soon, I'll have to try something else. I will wait again and hope the elevator starts moving.",
        "[T144.7] Okay, still in the elevator and still waiting. It's really taking its time. I pressed the button a while ago, and I should be at the lobby by now. The fact that there are no exits listed is making me a bit nervous. Is this elevator even working? It's been a while, and nothing has happened. Maybe I should try pressing the button again? Or maybe I should try a different button, like the emergency stop button, just to see if anything happens at all. I'm starting to feel a little trapped in here. This is not helping my mood, especially with the news about the courthouse attack weighing on my mind. I was so ready for some good sushi in Williamsburg, but now I'm stuck in a possibly broken elevator. I'm not going to try the emergency stop button just yet, but I will press the Lobby button again to see if that does anything. Maybe it didn't register the first time. I am going to use the control panel to go to the building lobby again.",
        "[T152.2] Okay, still in the elevator and still waiting... and waiting. It's really taking its time. I pressed the button *again*, and it's still descending. This is ridiculous. I am so ready to get out of this building and forget about that crazy news for a while. Maybe I should just try pressing another button. I'm getting a little freaked out that this elevator might be broken. Maybe there's an alarm button I can press? I think I'll look around again and see if I can find an alarm or call button. It's not like I can do anything else in here. If there isn't another way out of here, I am going to be really annoyed. It's Monday, I want sushi, and I am stuck. I will look around the elevator again to try and find a call button, or a way to get help.",

Should I just try to go to the 2nd floor? Or the 1st floor? Maybe if I go to one of those, the elevator will 'reset' itself. Since the two floors are listed as exits, they have to be valid options. I am going to press the button for the first floor. It will at least be something different. I will use the control panel to go to the 1st floor.",
        "[T173.2] Okay, still in the elevator and still waiting... and waiting. It's *still* really taking its time. I pressed the button for the 1st floor, and it *still* isn't descending. I'm honestly starting to get a little scared. I am so ready to get out of this building and forget about that crazy news for a while. The elevator panel looks normal, and I already pressed the lobby button a few times. The information display just indicates the floor. Maybe I can try to get someone to help me. There should be an alarm button that I can press. Maybe it will connect me to the front desk or someone who can help me get out of here. I am going to look at the elevator panel again for the alarm button, and then use the alarm button.",
        "[T181.6] Okay, still in the elevator and still waiting... and waiting. It's *still* really taking its time. I pressed the alarm button on the elevator panel, so hopefully, someone will come to help me soon. I am so ready to get out of this building and forget about that crazy news for a while. The elevator panel looks normal, and I already pressed the lobby button a few times. Maybe someone heard the alarm and is on their way. I am going to wait and listen for any sounds of someone coming to rescue me from this elevator. Maybe they'll have a key to open the door. I hope they hurry, because I am going to be stuck here all day. It's Monday, and I was really craving that sushi. Now I'm just sitting here in a broken elevator with a flashing light and a loud alarm. I will wait and listen for someone. I really hope someone gets here soon.",
        "[T196.6] Okay, still in the elevator and still waiting... and waiting. It's *still* really taking its time. The alarm is blaring, and the red light is flashing. This is getting ridiculous, and honestly, a little scary. The news of the courthouse attack is definitely not helping my anxiety right now. It sounds like it would take a while for emergency services to respond. I just want to get out of this building and get some sushi. Okay, calm down, Daniel. I pressed the alarm button, so someone *should* be coming soon. Since it's taking so long, maybe I should try something else. Looking at the exits again... I could try going to the 1st or 2nd floor, but I really want to get to the lobby. It is Monday afternoon, and I feel like being stuck would make me feel even worse. Since no one is coming to help me, I'll just try going to the 1st floor. I'm going to use the control panel to go to the 1st floor.",
        "[T207.9] Okay, I'm finally out of that blasted elevator. I can't believe how long that took. And the alarm... ugh. Hopefully, no one heard it. I'm on the first floor now. So, the good news is that I'm no longer trapped. I see the door to Apartment 1A and the elevator I just came out of, which goes back to the Lobby. I *still* want to get to that sushi place in Williamsburg, and this whole elevator fiasco has just made me want it more. So, back to the original plan. I need to get to the lobby. I'll just take the elevator back down. Hopefully, it actually *works* this time. Maybe it was just a temporary glitch. I am really hungry, and sushi sounds so good right now. The news from this morning is still bothering me, and I just want to relax. I'm going to get back in that elevator and try going to the lobby again. Third time's the charm, right? I will use the elevator to go to the lobby.",
        "[T243.7] Okay, I'm finally in the lobby, but what a mess that was! It's cloudy outside, which matches my mood pretty well right now. Still determined to get to that sushi place in Williamsburg. The elevator doors are right there, but I'm not going back in *that* thing. I need to look around and see how I can actually *leave* this building. There has to be an exit somewhere, right? Let's check for doors.",
        "[T252.5] Okay, a unicorn just appeared in front of me. What? Seriously? After all the elevator stuff, now this? Is this some kind of joke? Or am I hallucinating? Maybe that alarm was louder than I thought... Okay, focus, Daniel. Unicorns don't just *appear* in apartment lobbies. I need to figure out what's going on. Maybe it's part of an art installation? Or a very elaborate prank? Either way, I'm still in the lobby, still need to get to Williamsburg, and now there's a unicorn. It's definitely not on the list of entities that I was expecting to be in this location. I'm going to try to ignore the unicorn for a second and focus on leaving the building. According to the exits, the street is that way. I am going to move towards the entrance to E 57th street."
