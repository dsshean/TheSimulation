    "[T6.4] At 12:46 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava's eyes adjust to the light filtering through the blinds. Her bedroom, though tidy, has a lived-in feel. A queen-sized **bed (bed_01)** dominates the space, its blue duvet slightly rumpled. Beside it, a **nightstand (nightstand_01)** holds a reading lamp and her phone. Across from the bed, a **dresser (dresser_01)** stands against the wall, topped with a framed photo of her family. She spots a **doorway (doorway_01)** on the far wall, presumably leading to the rest of the apartment.",
    "[T9.6] Ava Sharma's action failed: At 12:46 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), world_action is not a valid action type.",
    "[T19.9] At 12:46 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava walks through the doorway and finds herself in the apartment interior. It's a somewhat generic space, needing a bit of exploration to determine its precise layout. She can see a glimpse of a **living room (living_room_01)** with a comfortable-looking sofa. To her right, there seems to be an **opening (kitchen_area_01)** that probably leads to the kitchen, her destination for lunch. Straight ahead, another **doorway (hallway_01)** suggests a hallway leading to other parts of the apartment.",
    "[T26.0] At 12:46 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava takes a moment to get her bearings in the apartment's main area. The space opens up into a combined living and dining area. To the left, she sees a comfortable **sofa (sofa_01)** and a **coffee table (coffee_table_01)**, forming a cozy living room setup. Directly ahead is a small **dining table (dining_table_01)** with two chairs. To the right, an open archway reveals the **kitchen (kitchen_01)**, gleaming with stainless steel appliances. She also notes a **hallway (hallway_01)** leading further into the apartment near the dining area, likely towards the bathroom and other rooms.",
    "[T42.6] At 01:30 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava walks into the kitchen. Sunlight, diffused by the cloudy sky outside, streams through the window above the sink. The stainless steel appliances gleam softly in the muted light. She spots a **refrigerator (refrigerator_kitchen_01)** to her left and a **stove (stove_kitchen_01)** to her right. A **countertop (countertop_kitchen_01)** runs along the wall, offering ample space for meal preparation.",
    "[T51.2] At 01:30 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava pulls open the refrigerator door. The cool air rushes out, carrying the faint scent of leftover takeout and fresh produce. Inside, she sees a carton of **eggs (eggs_01)** on the top shelf, a half-empty container of **yogurt (yogurt_01)**, and various **vegetables (vegetables_01)** in the crisper drawer. A bottle of **sparkling water (sparkling_water_01)** sits on the door.",
    "[T57.6] At 01:30 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava peers into the refrigerator, its interior illuminated by the cool, white light. On the top shelf, behind the **carton of eggs (eggs_01)**, she notices a plastic container holding leftover **chicken tikka masala (tikka_masala_01)** from last night's takeout \u2013 perfect. Below, on the door, various condiments are neatly arranged: **mustard (mustard_01)**, **mayonnaise (mayonnaise_01)**, and a jar of **pickles (pickles_01)**. The crisper drawers are filled with slightly wilted **spinach (spinach_01)** and a lonely **tomato (tomato_01)**.",
    "[T65.1] At 01:30 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), reaching into the refrigerator, Ava bypasses the **carton of eggs (eggs_01)**, the **wilted spinach (spinach_01)**, and the **lonely tomato (tomato_01)**. She grabs the half-empty container of **yogurt (yogurt_01)** from the middle shelf. As she pulls it out, she notices a small, handwritten note (note_refrigerator_01) stuck to the side of the fridge with a magnet. It's a reminder to buy groceries.",
    "[T71.4] At 01:31 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava grins as she lifts the container of **chicken tikka masala (tikka_masala_01)** from the refrigerator. The aroma of spiced tomato and tender chicken wafts up, already making her mouth water. She closes the refrigerator door, the dim kitchen momentarily illuminated before returning to its cloudy-day ambiance.",
    "[T80.1] At 01:31 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), with a slight sigh, Ava returns the container of **yogurt (yogurt_01)** to its place on the refrigerator shelf, nudging aside the **carton of eggs (eggs_01)** to make room. She briefly contemplates the **handwritten note (note_refrigerator_01)** reminding her to buy groceries before closing the door with a soft click.",
    "[T86.9] At 01:31 PM on Thursday, May 22, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava opens the refrigerator once more. The cool air washes over her as she reaches past the **eggs (eggs_01)** and the **sparkling water (sparkling_water_01)**, carefully retrieving the container of **chicken tikka masala (tikka_masala_01)**. This time, she makes sure it's the right one."
