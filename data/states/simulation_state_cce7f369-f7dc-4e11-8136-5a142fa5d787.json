    "[T3.6] At 11:28 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), the apartment is quiet. Ava takes in the familiar sight of her living room: a comfortable couch sits invitingly in the dim light, a wooden coffee table stands before it, and a tall bookshelf packed with books lines one wall. She notices the front door leading out to the street and the doorway to the kitchen.",
    "[T12.7] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez surveys the room, the soft glow of a standing lamp illuminating the space. A large television dominates one wall, currently dark, reflecting the room's dim ambiance. He notes a family photo frame on a nearby table, a glimpse of a life he presumably knows. From where he stands, Daniel can see doorways leading to the kitchen, the hallway, and the bedroom, offering potential exits. The front door to the street is also visible, a direct path to the overcast night outside.",
    "[T26.8] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava takes in the familiar scene. The TV remote control sits on the coffee table, within easy reach. A soft throw blanket is casually draped over the couch, looking inviting. On the windowsill, the potted house plant adds a touch of green to the room under the dim light of the overcast night, despite the recent news headlines. She also notices the doorway to the bathroom and the sliding glass door leading out to the balcony.",
    "[T34.9] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel asks Ava, \"Hey Ava, what are you up to? Feeling like watching a movie or just chilling?\"",
    "[T39.1] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava steps into the bathroom. The light is on, a stark contrast to the dimmer living room she just left. The overcast night outside is faintly visible through the small window above the toilet.",
    "[T46.1] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava, back in the living room, replies to Daniel, \"Hey Daniel, that sounds nice. What kind of movie were you thinking?\"",
    "[T45.7] Daniel Rodriguez's action failed: At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez tried to talk to Ava Sharma, but they are not in the same location.",
    "[T49.8] Ava Sharma's action failed: At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava Sharma (sim_b797o8) tried to talk to Daniel Rodriguez, but they are not in the same location.",
    "[T56.1] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel, settling further into his couch as the overcast night deepened, continued his conversation with Ava. \"Great! I was thinking about that new indie film everyone's been talking about. But what kind of movie are you in the mood for?\"",
    "[T59.7] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava re-enters her apartment. The dim overhead lighting casts long shadows in the living room as she moves further inside from the bathroom, still thinking about her conversation with Daniel. The overcast sky outside reflects a dull light into the room, offering little additional illumination.",
    "[T61.9] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel's question hangs in the air, a casual query against the backdrop of the late-night overcast sky. \"What genres are you in the mood for?\" he asks, the television casting a faint glow across his face as he waits for Ava's reply.",
    "[T62.5] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava, already home, pauses in her apartment, the overcast night casting a pall over the city according to the news, as she mentally confirms her location, perhaps a little preoccupied.",
    "[T68.7] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel, relaxing on his couch beneath the overcast sky while news of an infant death and a fire played softly on the TV, followed up, \"I was thinking maybe something indie, but what are you in the mood for?\"",
    "[T70.3] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava confirms she is already home, a fact that barely registers as she's likely still preoccupied with her conversation with Daniel, the overcast night and somber news reports of an infant death and a fire fading into background noise.",
    "[T77.2] At 11:29 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel's voice cut through the quiet of the late night. \"Any particular genre you're in the mood for?\" he asked, the television murmuring in the background, a mix of somber news and low ambient noise filling his apartment as the overcast sky outside dimmed the city lights.",
    "[T80.9] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava heard Daniel's voice through her phone. The news reports of a recent infant death and a fire flicker from a nearby television, the overcast sky outside casting long shadows across her apartment as she considered his question. \"Maybe something lighthearted? What do you think?\" he asked, and she began to weigh her options for a distraction from the day's events.",
    "[T86.3] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava, settling further into her couch as the overcast night deepened, responded to Daniel, \"Hey! Sorry about that, I was still in the bathroom. Something light, like a comedy, would be great.\"",
    "[T90.5] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel paused, considering Ava's suggestion of something lighthearted. The overcast night pressed against the windows of his apartment, the faint glow of the TV screen reflecting on his face as he scrolled through streaming options. He chuckled softly, \"Alright, something funny it is. How about this one? I saw a trailer earlier and it looked pretty ridiculous.\"",
    "[T95.0] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava, still settling into the cushions on her couch, finalized her thoughts. \"I'm thinking something light, like a comedy. I'm still a little groggy, so nothing too intense,\" she said to Daniel through the phone. A notification flashed on her phone, another news update on the infant death dominating the headlines.",
    "[T99.6] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava continued the conversation with Daniel, her voice still a little thick with sleep. \"I'm thinking something light, maybe a comedy? What indie movies did you have in mind? I'm still a little groggy,\" she said, settling deeper into her couch as the overcast night pressed against the windows of her apartment. The faint blue light of her phone illuminated her face, another notification hinting at the grim news dominating the headlines.",
    "[T103.2] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel, settling back on his own couch, responded to Ava's suggestion. The overcast night deepened outside, muting the city lights. He ran a hand through his hair. \"How about something lighthearted?\" he asked into the phone, the television murmuring quietly in the background.",
    "[T107.8] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel's voice echoed through Ava's phone, a gentle counterpoint to the quiet hum of her apartment. The overcast night deepened outside, painting the sky in shades of grey as he responded to her through the phone line. The news headlines about the infant death flickered briefly on her phone screen as she listened.",
    "[T113.2] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava spoke into the phone, her voice still carrying a hint of sleepiness. \"I was thinking something light, maybe a comedy, since I'm still a bit groggy. What indie movies were you thinking of?\" she asked Daniel, adjusting the blanket around her on the couch. The overcast night outside muted the city sounds, and the latest news notification about the infant death lingered on her phone screen.",
    "[T128.9] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel Rodriguez listened attentively to Ava's explanation about wanting to watch a light comedy. He could hear the faint rustling of fabric over the phone, likely Ava adjusting on her couch. The television in his living room provided a low, constant hum in the background as he waited for her to finish her thought. He glanced out the window at the overcast night, the city lights diffused and muted by the heavy cloud cover.",
    "[T121.2] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava's question hung in the air as Daniel considered his options. The overcast night outside continued to muffle the city sounds. He could almost feel Ava's sleepiness through the phone line, picturing her nestled on her couch. Daniel chuckled softly, \"Well, when you say lighthearted comedy... my mind immediately goes to 'Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.' Have you seen it?\"",
    "[T127.0] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel continued, \"It was called \\\"Airplane Mode.\\\" Have you heard of it? It looked pretty dumb, in a good way.\" The television flickered in the background, casting faint shadows across the room as he waited for Ava's response. Outside, the overcast night pressed on, the city lights struggling to pierce through the thick cloud cover.",
    "[T129.2] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava, still on the phone with Daniel, asked, \"Which movie are you talking about? What's the name of it?\" The overcast night continued outside, muting the city sounds and casting long shadows in her apartment. She could hear the faint static from Daniel's end of the line.",
    "[T134.0] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Daniel pressed on, a smile evident in his voice even through the phone. \"It's called 'Space Janitors 7: Cosmic Cleanup'. Have you heard of it?\" He waited, listening for Ava's reaction, the low hum of his television filling the brief silence. The overcast night kept the city muffled and quiet outside his window.",
    "[T140.7] At 11:30 PM on Thursday, May 29, 2025 (Local time for New York, New York), Ava, settling further into her couch as the overcast night muted the city outside, inquired again, her voice laced with curiosity, \"What's the name of the movie? I'm curious!\""
